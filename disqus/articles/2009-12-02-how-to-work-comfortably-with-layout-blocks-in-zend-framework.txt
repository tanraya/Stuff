<p>During my research, I found a convenient way to work with html blocks on the site. Almost every site has a number of blocks that should be present on some pages and absent on others. So, you need a flexible tool for managing the blocks.

I will present my vision of how to manage the blocks under Zend Framework.

~

Here is the idea.
All available blocks are listed in blocks.ini config. This allows easily to see all the blocks in one place.

I'll show how looks blocks.ini config. For example, we have config with two defined blocks, the toolbar block and the banner block:
</p>
<div class="gist-wrapper"><script src="https://gist.github.com/1768778.js?file=gistfile1.ini"></script></div>

As we can see, each block have specified module, controller and action. We can see where the block will get its data.
All we need to work with blocks is a <em>action controller helper</em>, <em>front controller plugin</em> and <em>blocks.ini</em> config.

With the <em>action helper</em> we specify blocks that will be loaded into layout or unloaded from layout. <em>Front controller plugin</em> directly controls the blocks loading, which occurs immediately after the dispatch of the controller.

So, let's see to action helper code:
<div class="gist-wrapper"><script src="https://gist.github.com/1768780.js?file=gistfile1.php"></script></div>
Then let's look at the front controller plugin, which controls the blocks loading into layout.
<div class="gist-wrapper"><script src="https://gist.github.com/1768783.js?file=gistfile1.php"></script></div>
As a result, in any controller of our application, we can work with blocks like this:
<div class="gist-wrapper"><script src="https://gist.github.com/1768785.js?file=gistfile1.php"></script></div>
We can output any block in layout by block name:
<div class="gist-wrapper"><script src="https://gist.github.com/1768787.js?file=gistfile1.php"></script></div>
By comments in the code should be clear how to work with blocks. You can even add to the action helper <em>addAll()</em> method to be able to load all the blocks at once, in a contrast to the <em>removeAll()</em> method - but it's on your taste.
