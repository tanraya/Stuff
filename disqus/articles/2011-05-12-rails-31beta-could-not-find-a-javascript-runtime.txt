<body><p>A tiny note for saving time.
If you're trying new rails 3.1.beta under Ubuntu you can see this error:

<em>Could not find a JavaScript runtime. See https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs for a list of available runtimes.</em>

The solution is quite simple. Just add gem 'therubyracer' into your Gemfile (it's for Ruby MRI). Done.

<em>Also, you can install another javascript runtimes. But who cares?</em></p></body>
